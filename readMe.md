## Website Description

Ultimate Finish is a local business, I know the owner, and unfortunately he has stopped trading. I was able to collect images from his instagram page, and I knew a bit about what he did.

## Objective

To produce a modern, responsive and optimised website which showcases what the business does.
The webste will be easy to navigate, will contain a consistent theme which feels like it belongs to the brand.
The goal would be to convert visitors into customers through the display of high quality image assets featuring finished work.
A clear break down of what the business does and an easy way for the visitor to reach the busness by displaying a contact number, email and contact form.

## Result

I used his existing logo as a colour palette for the theme which strengthened his existing brand. The colours were great to work with and I feel they make a great impact.
I used flickty to showcase images of finished work on the landing page, being the first thing a visitor will see, I felt that a gallery would be a great starting point to keep the visitor engaged.

## What was my Workflow

- **âœ… Research to-do applications** <br>
  Researched mobile & desktop applications which handle task lists, I made notes of layout and features.

- **âœ… Write up the idea of the project** <br>
  Made a list of features i wanted to include in my application from the research. I created a priority list, marked the most important tasks, and the rest were bonus objectives if I had enough time.
